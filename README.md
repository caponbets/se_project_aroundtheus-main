# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

**Intro**
This project was able to put the skills to the test, it was a little more advanced than some of the previous projects. A lot of the context used were made by scracth but thats not to say i wasn't able to copy elements from previous projects to make things easier. I was able to incorporate git hub to load the project to a repository and figma to provide how the layout would look on both mobile(320px) and desktop(1280px). the webpage was created to be responsive, meaning the width of the content will change even if your browser window is wider. For tablet screen widths, the design will be the same as for desktop.

**Images**
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
